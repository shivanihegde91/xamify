          <h2>Teacher Marks Entry</h2>
          <p>Teachers enter marks for their students after the exams. The teacher fills out a form or interface with the names of students and their corresponding marks. This data is then submitted to the system (to the admin) for review.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="info-box">
          <h2>Mark Submission to Admin</h2>
          <p>Once the teacher submits the marks, they are sent to the admin for review. The submission is done through an API or a direct submission method where the data gets stored in the database.</p>

          <h2>Admin Views Performance Data</h2>
          <p>Once the marks are submitted and stored, the admin can access them through an admin dashboard. The system retrieves the marks data and displays it in a graphical format, such as a bar graph. The bar graph will have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>X-axis: representing the students' names (or student IDs)</li>
            <li>Y-axis: representing the marks obtained by each student</li>
            <li>A bar for each student, indicating their performance</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div className="info-box">
          <h2>Key Insights from Performance Data</h2>
          <p>The bar graph can give insights such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The average score of the students</li>
            <li>The range of scores (e.g., highest, lowest)</li>
            <li>The distribution of students' marks across different ranges</li>
